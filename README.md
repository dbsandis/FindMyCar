# FindMyCar
building mechanism to search local car inventory daily 
Absolutely, Daryl — building a Python/Django backend that can later be migrated into an iOS app is a great idea, and doing it with a scalable architecture in mind from the beginning will save you a lot of time later.

✅ High-Level Task List for Used Car Aggregator App

⸻

Phase 1: Planning & Design
	1.	Define Data Model
	•	Decide on key entities: Vehicle, Dealer, Location, ScrapeJob, etc.
	•	Attributes: make, model, trim, year, engine, transmission, body type, mileage, price, etc.
	2.	Design Architecture
	•	Django REST API backend
	•	PostgreSQL or SQLite (dev)
	•	Scrapy or requests/BeautifulSoup for scraping
	•	Celery + Redis for daily scraping jobs
	•	Frontend: web (for now), then migrate to iOS via Swift or React Native

⸻

Phase 2: Project Setup
	3.	Setup Django Project
	•	Install Django, Django REST Framework
	•	Create core app (e.g., inventory)
	4.	Setup Database Models
	•	Create models: Dealer, Vehicle, ScrapeLog, etc.
	5.	Create Serializers & API Endpoints
	•	Expose endpoints for vehicles (filtered by make, model, etc.)
	•	Pagination, filtering, and search

⸻

Phase 3: Scraper Implementation
	6.	Build Web Scraper
	•	Use Scrapy or requests + BeautifulSoup
	•	Write scraper spiders for 2–3 example local dealer websites
	7.	Store Scraped Data
	•	Normalize data to your Django models
	•	Handle duplicate checking, updates, or stale data

⸻

Phase 4: Automation
	8.	Automate Scraping
	•	Use Celery + Redis to run daily scraping jobs
	•	Log scrape status (success/failure)

⸻

Phase 5: Search & Filter
	9.	Implement Filtering & Query
	•	Allow querying by: make, model, trim, engine, transmission, body type, price, mileage, location
	•	Consider search optimization using Django filters or ElasticSearch (if needed)

⸻

Phase 6: Prepare for iOS Integration
	10.	Build REST API Endpoints
	•	Document with Swagger/OpenAPI
	•	Secure with token or OAuth
	11.	Test with Mobile Client
	•	Build a simple frontend in Django or React for testing
	•	Or test endpoints using Postman to prepare for mobile app

⸻

Phase 7: Optional Enhancements
	12.	Add Geolocation Support
	•	Auto-detect user’s region or zip code
	•	Filter results by radius or city
	13.	Add User Accounts (optional)
	•	Save favorite cars, alert on price drops, etc.
	14.	Migrate to iOS App
	•	Build Swift/SwiftUI frontend
	•	Connect to Django API

Would you like to start with:
	•	the Django project structure and models?
	•	or the scraper prototype for local dealer websites?
